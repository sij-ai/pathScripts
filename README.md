# PATH-worthy Scripts 🛠️

A collection of various scripts I use frequently enough to justify keeping them in my system PATH. 

I haven't written documentation for all of these scripts. I might in time. Find documentation for some of the highlights below.

## Installation

1. Clone and enter repository:

```bash
git clone https://sij.ai/sij/pathScripts.git
cd pathScripts
```

2. Add to your system PATH:

macOS / ZSH:
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:$PWD\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Linux / Bash:
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:$PWD\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Make scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x *
```

## 📄 bates - PDF Bates Number Tool

Extracts and renames PDFs based on Bates numbers.

pip3 install pytesseract pdf2image
brew install tesseract poppler  # macOS
# or
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr poppler-utils  # Debian
```

### Usage
```bash
bates /path/to/folder --prefix "FWS-" --digits 6 --name-prefix "FWS "
```

### Key Features
- Extracts Bates numbers from text/scanned PDFs
- Renames files with number ranges
- Prepare files for use with my [Bates Source Link](https://sij.ai/sij/DEVONthink/src/branch/main/Bates%20Source%20Link.scpt#) DEVONthink script
- Preserves original names in Finder comments
- OCR support for scanned documents
- Dry-run mode with `--dry-run`

### Options
- `--prefix`: The Bates number prefix to search for (default: "FWS-")
- `--digits`: Number of digits after the prefix (default: 6)
- `--ocr`: Enable OCR for scanned documents
- `--dry-run`: Test extraction without renaming files
- `--name-prefix`: Prefix to use when renaming files
- `--log`: Set logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

### Examples
```bash
# Test without making changes
bates /path/to/pdfs --prefix "FWS-" --digits 6 --dry-run

# Rename files with OCR support
bates /path/to/pdfs --prefix "FWS-" --digits 6 --name-prefix "FWS " --ocr
```

### Notes
- Always test with `--dry-run` first
- Original filenames are preserved in Finder comments (macOS only)
- OCR is disabled by default to keep things fast
