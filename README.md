# PATH-worthy Scripts üõ†Ô∏è

A collection of various scripts I use frequently enough to justify keeping them in my system PATH. 

I haven't written documentation for all of these scripts. I might in time. Find documentation for some of the highlights below.

## Installation

1. Clone and enter repository:

```bash
git clone https://sij.ai/sij/pathScripts.git
cd pathScripts
```

2. Add to your system PATH:

macOS / ZSH:
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:$PWD\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Linux / Bash:
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:$PWD\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Make scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x *
```

### Examples
```bash
# Test without making changes
bates /path/to/pdfs --prefix "FWS-" --digits 6 --dry-run

# Rename files with OCR support
bates /path/to/pdfs --prefix "FWS-" --digits 6 --name-prefix "FWS " --ocr

## üê™ camel - File Renaming Utility

Renames files in the current directory by splitting camelCase, PascalCase, and other compound words into readable, spaced formats.

- **Smart Splitting**:
  - Handles camelCase, PascalCase, underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), and spaces.
  - Preserves file extensions.
  - Splits on capital letters and numbers intelligently.

  - Renames files in-place with clear logging.

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install nltk
   ```

Run the script in the directory containing the files you want to rename:
```bash
./camel
```

## üîÑ push & pull - Bulk Git Repository Management

Scripts to automate updates and management of multiple Git repositories.

### Setup

1. **Create a Repository List**  
   Add repository paths to `repos.txt` in the same directory as the scripts, one per line:
   ```plaintext
   ~/workshop/sijapi
   ~/workshop/scripts/gitea/pathScripts
   ~/workshop/Nova/Themes/Neonva/neonva.novaextension
   ~/workshop/scripts/Swiftbar
   ```

2. **Make Scripts Executable**  
   ```bash
   chmod +x push pull
   ```

3. **Run the Scripts**  
   ```bash
   ./pull    # Pulls the latest changes from all repositories
   ./push    # Pulls, stages, commits, and pushes local changes
   ```

### Features

#### `pull`
- Recursively pulls the latest changes from all repositories listed in `repos.txt`.
- Skips directories that are not Git repositories.
- Forces pull to ensure synchronization.

#### `push`
- Pulls the latest changes.
- Stages and commits all local changes with an auto-generated message: `Auto-update: <timestamp>`.
- Pushes updates to the current branch.
- Configures the `origin` remote automatically if missing.

### Notes
- Both scripts skip empty lines and comments (`#`) in `repos.txt`.
- Ensure `repos.txt` is in the same directory as the scripts.
- Use absolute or relative paths for repository locations.
- `push` will auto-configure `origin` based on directory name if missing.

## üåê `vitals` - System and VPN Diagnostics

The `vitals` script provides detailed system diagnostics, VPN status, DNS configuration, and uptime in JSON format. It integrates with tools like AdGuard Home, NextDNS, and Tailscale for network monitoring.

1. **Set up a DNS rewrite rule in AdGuard Home**:
   - Assign the domain `check.adguard.test` to your Tailscale IP or any custom domain.
   - Update the `adguard_test_domain` variable in the script if using a different domain.

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   ./vitals
   ```

   Example output (JSON):
   ```json
   {
       "local_ip": "192.168.1.2",
       "wan_connected": true,
       "wan_ip": "185.213.155.74",
